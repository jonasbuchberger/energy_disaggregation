abstract = {Over the years, an enormous amount of research has been exploring Deep Neural Networks (DNN), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for estimating the energy consumption of appliances from a single point source such as smart meters - Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). However, most of the existing DNNs models for NILM use a single-task learning approach in which a neural network is trained exclusively for each appliance. This strategy is computationally expensive and ignores the fact that multiple appliances can be active simultaneously and dependencies between them. In this work, we propose UNet-NILM for multi-task appliances' state detection and power estimation, applying a multi-label learning strategy and multi-target quantile regression. The UNet-NILM is a one-dimensional CNN based on the U-Net architecture initially proposed for image segmentation. Empirical evaluation on the UK-DALE dataset suggests promising performance against traditional single-task learning.},

abstract = {Energy disaggregation is the process of extracting the power consumptions of multiple appliances from the total consumption signal of a building. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been very popular for this task in the last decade. In this paper we propose two recurrent network architectures that use sliding window for real-time energy disaggregation. We compare this approach to existing techniques using six metrics and find that it scores better for multi-state devices. Finally, we compare ANNs that use Gated Recurrent Unit neurons against those using Long Short-Term Memory neurons and find that they perform equally.},
